# Implement your own version of ruby's `Forwardable` module.

Ruby's [`Forwardable`][fwd] module makes it simple to create classes
that delegate methods to other objects.

Can you create a module that behaves in a similar way?

There is a simple spec provided that should help you know when you are
done. Feel free to add any more specs that you think you need.
